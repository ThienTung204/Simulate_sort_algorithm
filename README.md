üß† Sorting Algorithm Visualization in C (Graphics)
A program that visually simulates sorting algorithms using the graphics.h library in C. Users can interact with the program using a mouse to choose a sorting algorithm and observe the sorting process in real time.

üöÄ Features
Read data from a file (text.txt) or input from the keyboard
  -Generate random data
  -Supports 4 sorting algorithms:
    +Selection Sort
    +Bubble Sort
    +Insertion Sort
    +Quick Sort (pivot selected from the middle)
  -Simple and intuitive graphical interface
  -Shuffle array to retry with different order
üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Running
Requirements:
A compiler that supports graphics.h, such as Turbo C++, WinBGIm with Dev C++, or using DOSBox
Operating System: Windows
How to Run:
1 Make sure the graphics.h library is correctly installed
2 Place text.txt in the same directory as the executable
3 Compile and run the program
4 Use the mouse to interact with the interface:
    Read File: Load array from file
    Try Again: Clear and redraw the canvas
    Key Board: Input array manually
    Random: Generate a random array
    Shuffle: Randomly shuffle the array
    Choose one of the 4 sorting algorithms to visualize the process
